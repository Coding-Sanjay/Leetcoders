Problem statement :

  * Given an array "nums" with "n" numbers of objects colored red, white and blue.

  * We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

  * we sort the array based on the values without using Built-in library sort funtion.


Example 1:

  Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]

  Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]

Example 2:

  Input: nums = [2,0,1]

  Output: [0,1,2]

Code Explanation :

  Step 1 : We want to sort the array based on color, with red (0) coming first, followed by white (1), and then blue (2).

  Step 2 : Since we only deal with three colors (0, 1, 2), create an array of size 3.

  Step 3 : Count the occurrences of each color in the "nums" array and store the counts in the "arr" array.

  Step 4 : Count the occurrences of each color in the "nums" array and store the counts in the "arr" array. Traverse the "arr" array, and 
          for each index, create a loop that iterates the count value times, placing the index value into the "nums" array.
