Analysis the problem statement : 

    1. At a Lemonade stand, each lemonade costs is $5.
    2. Customers are standing in the queue for buy lemonade.
    3. Each customers buy a lemonade and they pay with either $5, $10 and $20.
    4. You must provide the correct change to the customer.
    5. # Note that you do not have any change in hand at first.
    6. Given an Integer array bills, where bills[i] is the bill the ith customer pays.
    7. # Return true if you can provide every customer with the correct change, or false otherwise.

Example 1 :

Input: bills = [5,5,5,10,20]

Output: true

Explanation: 
    * From the first 3 customers, we collect three $5 bills in order.
    * From the fourth customer, we collect a $10 bill and give back a $5.
    * From the fifth customer, we give a $10 bill and a $5 bill.
    Since all customers got correct change, we output true.

Example 2 : 

Input: bills = [5,5,10,10,20]

Output: false

Explanation: 
    * From the first two customers in order, we collect two $5 bills.
    * For the next two customers in order, we collect a $10 bill and give back a $5 bill.
    * For the last customer, we can not give the change of $15 back because we only have two $10 bills.
    Since not every customer received the correct change, the answer is false.


Code Explanation : 

> Firstly, the customer pays an amount for the lemonade, and we need to give them change. Suppose they pay with $10 or $20 bills. If they pay with $5, there are no issues. However, if they pay with $10, we must give them $5 as change. Similarly, if they pay with $20, we can either give them three $5 bills or one $10 bill and one $5 bill as change.

> Secondly, to give the correct change to customers, we need to track the count of bills. So, I created the variables amt5Count and amt10Count to store the count of $5 and $10 bills, respectively. You might wonder why I didn’t create a variable to track $20 bills. The reason is that we don’t give $20 bills back as change, so it’s unnecessary to track them.

> Thirdly, I used a for loop to traverse the array bills, checking the amount the customer pays:

    * If they pay $10, we increase the amt10Count by 1. Since we need to give $5 as change, we check if we have a $5 bill available. If we do, we decrease amt5Count by 1. If not, we return false.

    * If they pay $20, we check if we have either three $5 bills or one $10 bill and one $5 bill to give as change. If we do, we adjust the counts accordingly; otherwise, we return false.

    * If they pay $5, we increase the amt5Count by 1.

> Finally, if the entire process completes without returning false, we return true, indicating that we were able to give the correct change back to every customer.
